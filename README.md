B. Executable file: Demo_CPD_v01.m

C. Recommended Matlab version: 2019a or later

D. Instructions for Use
    Step 1: Select a test image in the "Image Index" section.
    Step 2: In the "Parameter" section,
            a. Determine the number of candidates (default is 5).
            b. Specify which candidate to use as the estimated kernel (default is 1).

E. Folder Description:
    1. Test Image: Places the test image.
    2. Parameter: Places the parameter file (.xlsx) used for the test image.
    3. Function: Places the sub-functions used by the algorithm.

p.s. Because the description and explanation of the sub-functions are not yet complete, we have initially released the .p file for readers' reference. 
     We will complete the description and explanation of the sub-functions as soon as possible and gradually release the .m file for readers' reference.
